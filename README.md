# PRODIGY_CS_01
Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption project

This project implements a simple Caesar cipher encryption/decryption tool using Python. The tool allows the user to shift letters in a message by a specified number, with the option to either encrypt or decrypt the message.

Features
Encrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher technique.
Decrypt messages that were encrypted using the Caesar Cipher.
User-friendly interface with options to choose between encryption and decryption.
Ability to handle both uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as non-alphabetic characters.
Installation
To run this program, you'll need Python installed on your system. You can download Python from python.org.

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

git clone https://github.com/christocy/PRODIGY_CS_01.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd PRODIGY_CS_01

How to Use

Run the program.

Choose 'encrypt(e)' or 'decrypt(d)':

Enter the message: 

Enter the shift value (positive integer): 

Get the encrypted or decrypted message.

Example

Encrypting the message "HELLO" with a shift of 3:
Input: HELLO
Shift: 3
Output: KHOOR

Decrypting the message "KHOOR" with a shift of 3:
Input: KHOOR
Shift: 3
Output: HELLO

This project was developed as part of a virtual internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
